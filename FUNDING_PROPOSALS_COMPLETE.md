**Total Funding Potential:**

- Or choose one: 500K EUR or 750K EUR
- Both banks have different advantages

### Recommendations

**Best Approach:**

**Option A: Submit to Both Banks Simultaneously**
- Maximize chances of approval
- Create competition (better terms)
- Have backup if one rejects
- Can choose best offer

**Option B: Start with ECOBANK (Recommended)**
- Larger amount (750K EUR vs 500K EUR)
- More aggressive growth possible
- Commercial bank (faster decisions)
- Pan-African presence (future expansion help)
- Then use ECOBANK approval to negotiate with BCAO

**Option C: Start with BCAO**
- Central bank (more prestige)
- Lower amount (less risk for first loan)
- Government backing
- Then raise more from ECOBANK later

**My Recommendation: Option B (ECOBANK first)**
- 750K EUR is right amount for aggressive launch
- ECOBANK has tech focus and understands startups
- Faster approval process (6-8 weeks vs 10-12 weeks)
- Success with ECOBANK makes BCAO easier later if needed
