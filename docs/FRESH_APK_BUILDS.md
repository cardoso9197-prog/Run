## 🎯 Why Fresh Builds Are Needed

The previous APK builds were created BEFORE the code changes were made. Even though the code is updated in GitHub, the old APK files still contain the old code. These fresh builds will include:

1. All code changes from commit 183daff
2. Removed debug logs button
3. Updated support contact
4. Better error handling
